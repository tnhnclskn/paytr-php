## Composer

You can install the bindings via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). Run the following command:

```bash
composer require tnhnclskn/paytr
```

To use the bindings, use Composer's [autoload](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#autoloading):

```php
require_once('vendor/autoload.php');
```

## Dependencies

The bindings require the following extensions in order to work properly:

- [`curl`](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php), although you can use your own non-cURL client if you prefer
- [`json`](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/book.json.php)

## Getting Started

Simple usage looks like sample files in the `examples` directory.
